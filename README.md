This web game was part of a 24 hour coding challenge. 
How the game works:
Users join the current game with their name and then choose and upload an image.
Once all players have uploaded their image, the game starts. Each players image is then presented, allowing others to guess who uploaded that image.
Players who guess the most correctly are shown on a leaderboard at the end.

Built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Firebase for the backend.
